CS 145 Programming Assignment #2
// Copied from Assignment Overview
This assignment will give you practice with defining classes. You are to write a set of classes that define the behavior of certain animals. You will be given a program that runs a simulation of a world with many animals wandering around in it. Different kinds of animals will behave in different ways and you are defining those differences. In this world, animals propagate their species by infecting other animals with their DNA, which transforms the other animal into the infecting animalâ€™s species.
